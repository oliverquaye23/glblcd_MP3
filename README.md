# glblcd_MP3
A simple music playlist management system.

The aim of this challenge is to implement a Class in Python to maintain an MP3 Playlist. This class could be used when developing the software for a music App on a smartphone or an mp3 player.

This MP3 playlist will be stored as a queue of MP3 tracks. When new tracks are being added to the playlist, they are enqueued at the end of the playlist.

The key features that we will implement within this class are the ability to:

 Load a playlist from a text file
 Display all the tracks from the playlist
 Enqueue (Add) an MP3 to the playlist

Additionally implement the following features within the Playlist class:

 Remove an MP3 from the playlist
 Save a playlist on a text file
 Shuffle all the songs in the playlist
 Count the number of tracks in the playlist
 Calculate the total duration of the playlist
 Clear/Reset the playlist
 Check if the playlist is empty
